# Where's That Book From?
### Software Design Spring 2017
### Final Project

Have you ever wondered where your favorite book takes place? How about where the author is from, or where the book was published? Then our software, "Where's That Book From" (WTBF), is for you!

Scan or enter the ISBN code of any book, and our program will present you with a map highlighting where the story takes place, where the other is from, and where the book was published. Check it out!
