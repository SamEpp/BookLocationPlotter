# Project Evolution

#### Tell an illustrative story about the process of creating your software, showing how it improved over time. This may draw upon what you learned from the two peer technical reviews and from the code review. Consider the use of screenshots or other tools to demonstrate how your project evolved.

At the start of this journey, we had only two things: a desire to work with maps and visualization, and a curiosity about where things come from. The original project idea was an interactive visualization of global commerce that taught a user about the origin of the materials that make up different products. As we further defined our learning goals and our sense of scope, this idea evolved into what it is today.

In the beginning stages of work, our main struggles involved the Wikipedia API. Documentation was sparse and often unhelpful, which caused our building of the structures we needed to be a long exploratory process. We wrote over 100 lines of code that ended up being simplified down to 3.

Wikipedia and Plotly were our greatest struggles
