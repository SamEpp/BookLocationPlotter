## Welcome to Book Location Plotter
### **Team InterWEBS**: Gracey Wilson, Sam Eppinger, Sarah Barden, Rowan Sharman
Have you ever wondered where your favorite book takes place? What about where the author of the book is from? How do those two things relate to where the publisher of the ook is located? Well this software is for you. All that is needed is a book's barcode which we will scan into our program and output a map with all the information you've been missing for so long.
