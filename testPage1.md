***This is me trying again because I fucked up before***

Code needed to make an image show up in a markdown file
(it won't show up in markdown preview in atom, but it will
show up when you view it on github):

![alt text](link of photo which is also on github here, and then these empty quotes: "")

![alt text](https://github.com/graceyw/SoftDesFinalProject/blob/master/Structure.png "")
